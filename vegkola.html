                   <p>Veg Kolhapuri recipe with step by step photos – this spicy and tasty mixed vegetable based dish has its origin in kolhapur, a historical city in south maharashtra. Kolhapuri cuisine is known for its hot, spicy and pungent flavors. however, not all the food from the Kolhapuri cuisine is spicy & robust.</p>

               <div class="text2">
                   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
                   <p>I have been to kolhapur many times and have got the opportunity to savor the authentic vegetarian Kolhapuri cuisine. From the spicy vada pav on the roadside to chili pitla (spicy gram flour based dish) and the famous & fiery Kolhapuri misal (sprouted moth beans curry). We have also had Kolhapuri dal and it was a spicy dal. On occasions we even had Kolhapuri thalis there.</p>
                   <p>Last time, on a visit there, I got the Kolhapuri kanda lasun masala (onion-garlic masala). This spice blend is so good that it simply perks up the flavor of the recipe in which it is added. I have added it many times to vegetables and dal (lentils) dishes.</p>
                   <p>In kolhapur, I never came across vegetable Kolhapuri. at least in the restaurants and hotels we stayed and went, there was never a mention of this particular dish. Though, I have seen veg Kolhapuri mentioned in the menu of North Indian restaurants.</p>
                   <p>This recipe of veg Kolhapuri is inspired from one of the hot dishes from the Kolhapuri cuisine – Tambda rassa. tambda means ‘red’ and rassa means ‘thin curry or gravy’. Tambda rassa is actually a non vegetarian dish which make use of the bold and fiery Kolhapuri masala. One of the ingredients of the authentic Kolhapuri masala is red chili powder made from lavangi chilies. these chilies are small, but very hot.</p>
                   <pFor this veg Kolhapuri recipe, I have toned down the fieriness by not using lavangi mirchi. Instead I have added byadagi chilies, which give a deep color and are low in heat. You can also add Kashmiri red chilies. So depending on the type of red chili added, you can increase or decrease the elements of heat and pungency in this dish.</p>
                   <p>The Kolhapuri masala is freshly made for the curry. so you don’t need to have ready-made store bought Kolhapuri masala. Though, if you have it, I have mentioned the amount in the notes section of recipe details, towards the end of the post. For the Kolhapuri masala, I referred to some of the cookbooks, which I got from kolhapur.</p>
                   <p>Add any veggies of your choice. Vegetable Kolhapuri is best served with chapatis, bajra bhakri or jowar bhakri, phulkas and even parathas. We even had it with bread. The recipe is spicy and has some heat which most Indians can tolerate. But if you do not prefer spicy food, then cut down on the dry red chilies, garlic and ginger. You can also check this Paneer Kolhapuri which is adapted from this recipe and also not made very spicy.</p>
