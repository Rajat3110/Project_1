                   <p>Naan is a popular Indian flatbread, and this vegan naan is just as good if not better than Indian restaurant naan. It's fluffy and pillowy, soft and chewy yet crisp and flaky in some spots. It melts in your mouth and is the perfect bread for scooping up delicious Indian curries. Plus, it requires just a handful of simple ingredients.</p>

                   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
                   <p>Naan is an Indian leavened flatbread traditionally baked in a tandoor oven (a very hot clay oven). If you’ve been to an Indian restaurant, you’ve probably had the pleasure of eating naan. While there are dozens of amazing Indian breads, naan is probably the most well-known in the West. You’ll also find naan (and variations thereof) in the cuisines of Western and Southern Asia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
                   <p>Texturewise, naan is somewhat similar to Middle Eastern pita, but usually softer and thicker yet also more airy at the same time, thanks to its uneven gas pockets.</p>
                   <p>Most naan recipes start with all-purpose flour, salt, active dry yeast, and water. Yogurt or milk is often (though not always) added, and occasionally egg is added to the dough. The dough is kneaded by hand and then set aside to rise. In restaurants, the naan is usually baked in a tandoor oven, but in homes, it’s typically cooked in a very hot pan on the stove. The traditional Indian pan used is an iron tawa, but well-seasoned cast iron skillets also work well. Naan is almost always brushed with butter or ghee before serving.</p>

                   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                   <ul class="dir">
                       <li><p>¼ cup Curd or yogurt – can use cashew or almond yogurt</p></li>
                       <li><p>1 teaspoon sugar or organic unrefined cane sugar</p></li>
                       <li><p>1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 pinch baking soda</p></li>
                       <li><p>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</p></li>
                       <li><p>1 teaspoon salt or add as required</p></li>
                       <li><p>2 tablespoons oil – butter can also be added</p></li>
                       <li><p>¼ to ⅓ cup water or add as required</p></li>
                       <li><p>1 tablespoon onion seeds (kalonji) or melon seeds or sesame seeds</p></li>
                       <li><p>Butter or ghee or oil – as required for spreading on naan (optional)</p></li>
                  </ul>
                   <h2>Steps</h2>
                   <ol class="step">
                       <li><p>You need to use slightly more water because whole wheat flour requires more hydration. Use 3/4 cup (180 mL) instead of 2/3 cup (160 mL).</p></li>
                       <li><p>Rest the dough before kneading. Mix the dough in the bowl with the fork (it won’t fully come together), then let it rest uncovered for 30 minutes. This allows the flour to more fully absorb the liquid, resulting in a softer dough.</p></li>
                       <li><p>The naan needs a bit more time to cook on the stove. About 60-80 seconds on the first side, and 45 seconds on the second side. The first few naan always take longer to cook, as the pan is not as hot on the first naan as on the fifth naan.</p></li>
