                   <p>Matar paneer recipe – a popular Indian Curry dish made with green peas and Indian cottage cheese, is from the versatile Northern Indian cuisine that has many different (and delicious) variations. I’m sharing our family recipe of a flavorful and simple home-style mutter paneer.</p>

                   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
                   <p> An everyday dish of cottage cheese and peas mingled in a rich, tomato gravy. Matar paneer is made more often in North Indian homes for dinner or lunch. You can have it with chapati or naan and even mix with rice.</p>
                   <p>This simple homemade matar paneer is a family recipe spiced to perfection and cooked with green peas (matar or mutter in Hindi), and paneer which is Indian cottage cheese. It is also known as matar paneer ki sabji in Hindi.</p>
                   <p>I have been making this recipe for YEARS. I originally learned how to make it at my in-laws’ home – a classic Punjabi recipe that was simple, easy, and absolutely fuss-free!</p>
                   <p>All of that being said, this family recipe is not a restaurant-style matar paneer. It tastes absolutely delicious, but is much simpler and lends more of a homey, comforting feel.</p>
                   <p>I share three ways of making this dish – Stove-top pressure cooker (with step-by-step photo guide), in the Instant Pot and in a pan or skillet on the stove-top (whose instructions I have listed in the recipe card below).</p>
