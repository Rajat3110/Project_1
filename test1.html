                   <p>This classic fried rice recipe is loaded with fresh mixed veggies and aromatic spices for an incredibly hearty, flavorful vegan dish. Hands-down this is one of our favorite Chinese-inspired recipes. Not only is vegetable fried rice amazingly easy to make from scratch, it’s a naturally vegan dish that’s as good for you as it is delicious to eat. You can even tweak veg fried rice to be gluten-free simply by using GF-friendly soy sauce or tamari.</p>

                   <h2>About the recipe</h2>
                   <p>And although Chinese fried rice is a healthy option, it is loaded with lots of exciting flavors. Salty, umami, and savory soy sauce is balanced with spiced star anise, and raw scallions add a great pop of freshness you’ll love.</p>
                   <p>Otherwise, I’ve kept the ingredients list rather basic to allow each element to shine – the veggies really are the star here!</p>
                   <p>Fried rice with mixed veggies can be enjoyed by itself for a satisfying lunch, but it does go great with rich, saucy main dishes.</p>
                   <p>This recipe rivals even the best take out options, and I’m sure you will enjoy making it often as part of your Indo-Chinese meals.</p>
                   <p>Stir-frying at high heat in a cast-iron skillet or wok imparts a bit of smoky flavor and aroma. Though a stovetop in your home kitchen, cannot compete with the heat and temperature of the stovetops in Chinese restaurants, you can still make a great homemade fried rice.</p>
                   <p>I do not add Ajinomoto, but you can include it if you are comfortable with it. The umami, smoky flavors in my fried rice recipe come from stir-frying at high heat and adding mushrooms, toasted sesame oil to the dish.</p>
                   <p>Generally in restaurants, soy sauce is not added to fried rice, but I like to add for an umami flavor. Feel free to skip soy sauce if you do not prefer it.</p>
